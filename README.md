The Color Detection App uses OpenCV to detect and highlight specific colors (Red, Green, and Blue) from a live webcam feed. It converts the image to HSV color space and applies masks for each color range. Contours are detected, and bounding boxes with labels are drawn around the detected colors. This project showcases real-time color segmentation and contour detection techniques.
